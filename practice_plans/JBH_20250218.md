# Station Details

## Station 1 - Pete
Backwards and forwards transitions
- Players skate towards the first cone. Halfway there, they will transition to backwards.
- Go around the cone backwards and toward the next cone. Transition to forward halfway to the cone.
- The cycle repeats.

## Station 2 - Chris
Speed to the puck
- Coach will send a puck somewhere in the area of play
- First player will pursue the puck with speed and then attack the net
- Second player will be on a delay. When set loose, the player will pursue the puck carrier with speed.

## Station 3 - Chris
Backwards skating on defense
- Offensive player takes the puck and skates behind the pad and then down the boards with speed.
- Defense attacks the puck carrier by angling them and keeping them to the outside before taking away their space along the boards.
- Coaching points
    - Offense should use speed to try and get past the defense.
    - Defense needs to work on angle, timing, and gap to ensure the puck carrier is taken to the boards and does not drive the net.

## Station 4 - Pete
Skating with the puck with speed
- The player passes the puck to the coach, then skates hard at the coach to strip the puck.
- The player gathers the loose puck and then skates hard down the boards, makes a hard turn around the tire to the net and shoots.
- Coaching points
  - Skate fast with the puck by using one hand on the stick
  - If the initial poke check of the puck does not knock it loose, the player should stop and battle to take it.
