# Station Details
## NOTE: Station 1 and 2 will be run, then we will switch to stations 3, 4, and 5.

## Station 1 - Chris
Backwards and forwards transitions
- Players skate forwards to the first cone and transition to backwards
- Players skate backwards to the next cone and transition to forwards
- Repeat until the last cone
- Change direction to work the other transition direction after 5 minutes
- Coaching points: 
  - Players should face the same direction the whole time (face the benches side of the rink)
  - The transition to backwards should look like a hockey stop with the player's back facing the cone followed by a smooth switch to backwards skating (ideally with backwards crossovers)
  - The transition to forwards should be on the outside foot

## Station 2 - Pete
Stops and starts
- Players go one at a time stopping at each cone.
- Players need to focus on making full stops with the appropiate foot. Coaches need to watch and enforce this.
- After the last cone, follow the path around the bumpers back to the line to stay out of the way of the drills.
- Switch to tight turns around the cones after 5 minutes.

## Station 3 - Pete
Going around the opponent
- Players start with the puck and skate along the wall towards the coach.
- The coach plays the roll of an opponent and blocks the forward path of the player. 
- The player bounces the puck off the wall and skates around the other side of the coach, then picks up the puck and drives the net.
- Coaching points:
  - Players need to learn how hard and at what angle to bounce the puck so that it goes past the coach but not all the way to the corner.
  - The bounce should occur just before the player reaches the coach.
  - The bounce can be done from the forehand of the stick regardless of what handedness the player is
  - For added challenge once the players have this down, the coach can move towards or away from the boards to make the players decide how to go around.

## Station 4 - Chris
Attacking the puck carrier
- Player skates with speed around the pad while coach puts a puck in the corner.
- The player needs to pick up the puck with speed and then attack the net.
- The defending player will attack as the player comes around the pad. The player needs to take an appropriate angle and separate the puck.


## Groups:
- Travis, Finn, Cole, Bentley, Emma
- Eric, Kyle, Jordyn, Nick, Luke S., Logan
