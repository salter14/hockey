# Station Details

## Station 1
Corner battle 
1. Coach dumps the puck in the corner, two players battle for possesion and the winner takes the puck to the net for a shot.

## Station 2
Puck control, shoot, pass, shoot
1. The player skates hard with the puck to the first cone. Player should control the puck with only the top hand on the stick.
1. The player skates with a puck through the cones.
1. After the last cone, the player drives to the net and takes a shot.

## Station 2
Angling 1 on 1
1. Players start in two lines: one as defense and one as offense. Players should switch lines after each turn.
1. The forward skates with a puck to the board-side of the pad/cones and then down the boards to attack the net. Stopping, cutbacks, etc are encouraged.
1. The defense skates to the inside of the pad/cones and works to time his approach to the forward and angle the forward to the boards to prevent his path to the net. Stay with the player if they stop or cut back.
1. The defense cannot body check the player, but can use the body and stick to separate the puck from the forward.
1. If defense strips the puck from the forward, they should pass it back to the coach near the lines.  

## Station 3
Sharks and minnows with the puck
1. Start with one or two players designated as sharks.
2. All the minnows start with pucks. Minnows try to skate end to end without losingtheir puck. If a shark steals your puck, they become a minnow and you become a shark and must steal someone elseâ€™s puck.

## Station 4
Passing lanes game
1. Using a marker, divide the ice into three zones.
2. Designate one or two players to be in the middle.
3. The players in the end zones attempt to pass pucks to each other through the middle zone without being intercepted.
4. Players in the middle zone attempt to steal passes. All passes must be on the ice and direct (not off the boards).
5. If a player in the middle zone intercepts a pass, that player becomes a new passer. The old passer moves to the middle.

## Station 5
Battle and puck protection
1. Two players at a time are put into the playing area with a puck.
2. The players battle for possion and attempt to score.
3. Coaches should encourage players to use their body establish possession and protect the puck.
4. Rounds should last about 30 seconds to a minute. If a goal is scored faster than that, let them continue playing.


## Skating Drills (full ice)
- Two strides and crouch to touch the ice, repeat all the way down the ice
- Knee downs on each stride
- c-cuts right
- c-cuts left
- backwards c-cuts
- glide on one leg between the blue line, carve back and forth if you can
- cross overs (just step across, not a turn)
- red light / green light
