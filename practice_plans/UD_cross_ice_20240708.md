# Station Details

## Station 1
Corner battle progression
- Phase 1: Coach dumps the puck in the corner, the player retrieves it and passes it to the coach in front of the net.
- Phase 2: Coach dumps the puck in the corner, two players battle for possesion and the winner passes the puck to the coach in front of the net.
- Phase 3: Coach dumps the puck in the corner, two players battle for possesion and the winner takes the puck to the net for a shot.

## Station 2
Angling 1 on 1
1. Players start in two lines: one as defense and one as offense. Players should switch lines after each turn.
1. The forward skates with a puck to the board-side of the pad/cones and then down the boards to attack the net.
1. The defense skates to the inside of the pad/cones and works to time his approach to the forward and angle the forward to the boards to prevent his path to the net.
1. The defense cannot body check the player, but can use the body and stick to separate the puck from the forward.
1. If defense strips the puck from the forward, they should pass it back to the coach near the lines.  


## Station 3
Tight Turns

1. The player start without a puck and skate a tight loop around the first pad and then the second pad. The turning direction should be different for each pad to work turns in both directions.
1. After the pads, the player goes past the cone and pick up a puck.
1. The player weaves around the remaining cones with tight turns and then shoots on net.


## Station 4
Puck Possesion Game
1. Game is played with fewer pucks than players (e.g. 6 players and 4 pucks).
2. Players are confined to the game area and seek to get and keep a puck from the other players.
3. Coach starts a round and players battle for pucks and take them from other players.
4. Rounds last 30-60 seconds (adjust as needed for skill/ability).
5. At the end of the round, any player with out a puck is out, and the next round starts with fewer players and pucks.
6. The player with the puck in the last round is the winner.
7. All players rejoin the game and it starts again.


## Station 5
Passing Keep Away
1. Players position spread out around the circle.
2. The coach (or player, depending on skil/ability) attemps to intercept a pass or get to the player with the puck before they pass it.
3. Players should focus on moving the puck quickly and making flat, smooth passes to another player's stick.
