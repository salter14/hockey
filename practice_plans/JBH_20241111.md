# Station Details

## Station 1 - Ryan
- Pass to Coach, skate towards the black bumper, jump over
- Tight turns around the pad, then crash towards the net while receiving a pass back from coach to take a shot.

## Station 2 - Lorne
Tight Turns
1. The player carries a puck and skates a tight loop around the first pad and then the second pad. The turning direction should be different for each pad to work turns in both directions. Coaches should encourage the players to stay close to the pads.
1. After the pads, the player passes the puck to the coach and then goes around the tire/cone.
1. Coach passes the puck back to the player.
1. The player weaves through the remaining cones with tight turns and then shoots on net.
1. Coaching points:
   1. Tight turns with both skates on the ice, inside foot leading the outside foot.
   2. Stick and puck lead the player around the cones.
   3. Ensure players are using their backhand on turns as appropriate.

## Station 3 - Chris S
1-on-1
- Offense carries the puck around the tire and attacks the net.
- Defense mirrors offense and transitions to backwards around the cone to defend.
- Defense should work on timing the turn to ensure a tight gap with the other player. Stick should be active. Keep the player to the outside. Don't lunge forward.


## Station 4 - Josh
Puck race with pass
- The first player skates to the near hash mark and stops.
- Player passes the puck to the next player in line, and then recieves a return pass.
- After receivint the return pass, the player skates around the cone near the blue line and back to the line.
- The next player goes and repeats the above steps until the whole team has gone. First team done wins.
- Each team should only have one puck available to them to ensure good passes are made. If the pass is off the mark, they need to retrieve the puck.
- Variation: Have the players skate backwards. 

## Station 5 - Chris L
- Player makes pass to coach standing on goal line and skates along the left side of the bumper.
- Once they reach the end of the bumper, turn towards the boards and open up to receive a breakout pass back from Coach.
- Player receives the pass, skates to the second pad, makes a tight turn towards the net, and takes a shot.
