# Station Details

## Station 1 - Chris/Ryan
Crossovers
- Players skate a full lap around the first circle then a full lap around the second circle.
- Switch to backwards after 5 minutes.
- Coaching points
    - Ensure players are crossing over to generate speed while going around the circle

## Station 2 - Pete/Mike
Backwards and forwards transitions
- Players skate towards the first cone. Halfway there, they will transition to backwards.
- Go around the cone backwards and toward the next cone. Transition to forward halfway to the cone.
- The cycle repeats.

## Station 3 - Ryan
Backwards skating on defense
- One player is defense and one is offense.
- The offensive player skates with the puck behind the pad and then tries to get to the net.
- The defensive player should start ahead of the offensive player and must skate backwards.
- The defense should skate backwards and try to knock the puck away and keep the player to the outside.
- The defense should transition to forward if the offensive player is going to skate past them.
- Coaching points
    - Skating backwards instead of skating at the player with the puck prevents easy breakaways by staying with the offensive player
    - Help players with proper positioning on defense when the puck is in the opponent's end of the ice. Our defense often stays too far back in our end.

## Station 4 - Pete
Shoot, crash, score
- The player shoots a hard, low shot from a distance at a pad and then crashes the net quickly.
- Collect the rebound off the pad, make a move around it and put the puck in the net.
- Coaching points
    - Players should focus on a hard shot with weight transfer
    - Players should drive hard to the net after the shot. Urgency is key to getting a rebound before the goalie or the opponent.

## Station 5 - Chris
Hard pass around the boards
- Player 1 starts on the boards near the bumper and sends a hard pass/shot around the boards to player 2, and then follows the puck up the wall quickly.
- Player 2 receives the pass, skates around the tire, and drives the net for a shot.
- Player 1 takes the place of player 2.
- Player 2 returns to the line and the next player in line is now player 1.
- Coaching points:
  - HARD pass/shot around the boards from player 1. This was an issue at the tournament.
  - Player 1 should ensure they sweep the puck firmly, with it starting on their stick drawn back to near the back of their skate.
  - Player 1 should yell the name of player 2 before sending the puck.
