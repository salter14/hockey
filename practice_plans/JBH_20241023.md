# Station Details

## Station 1 - Chris
Break out
- Coach dumps the puck and two players work to break out.
- The closest player should pursue the puck and the other player should provide a passing outlet on the boards.
- The defense should pressure the player pursuing the puck. The coach may be the defensive player for the younger players or if the drill is not working well to give the forwards time to learn.
- After moving the puck to the support player, the puck pursuer should support the puck.
- Players continue up the ice for a shot.

## Station 2 - Paul
Keep-away
- Designate one player as "it".
- The other players attempt to keep the puck away from the "it" player.
- The players should spread out and pass the puck. The pads are there to keep the playing area constrained.
- When the "it" player gets possession of the puck, they join the other players and another player is named "it".
- If the "it" doesn't gain possession after a minute or so, switch the "it" player.

## Station 3 - Dave
2-on-1 dumped puck
- Two forwards and one defense go at a time.
- Coach dumps the puck into the left or right corner. The player to that side goes after the puck and the other player goes to the net.
- Defense should attack the puck and try to prevent a goal. If they get the puck, pass it back to the coach.
- The forwards should work together to score. The player that goes to the puck should make a pass to the front of the net and then follow it for a rebound chance.
- Coaching points: This is an evolution of the 1-on-1 drill from prior practices. If 2-on-1 doesn't work out well, revert to the 1-on-1.

## Station 4 - Ryan
Puck race
- The first player in line skates with the puck around the tires, attempting to get to the net before being caught by the next player.
- The second player is held back and then set loose to attempt to catch the player with the puck.
- The goal is to get the player with the puck to skate fast with the puck and for the second player to pursue with speed.
- If the second player catches the first, don't let them have a long battle. Kill the run and send the next group.
- Players should take turns going with and without the puck.
- Adjust the lead for the player with the puck based on the skill of both players.
