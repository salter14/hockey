# Station Details

## Station 1 - Chris
Break out


## Station 2 - Paul
Keep-away
- 

## Station 3 - Dave
2-on-1 dumped puck
- Two forwards and one defense go at a time.
- Coach dumps the puck into the left or right corner. The player to that side goes after the puck and the other player goes to the net.
- Defense should attack the puck and try to prevent a goal. If they get the puck, pass it back to the coach.
- The forwards should work together to score. The player that goes to the puck should make a pass to the front of the net and then follow it for a rebound chance.
- Coaching points: This is an evolution of the 1-on-1 drill from prior practices. If 2-on-1 doesn't work out well, revert to the 1-on-1.

## Station 4 - Ryan
Puck race
- The first player in line skates with the puck around the tires, attempting to get to the net before being caught by the next player.
- The second player is held back and then set loose to attempt to catch the player with the puck.
- The goal is to get the player with the puck to skate fast with the puck and for the second player to pursue with speed.
- If the second player catches the first, don't let them have a long battle. Kill the run and send the next group.
- Players should take turns going with and without the puck.
- Adjust the lead for the player with the puck based on the skill of both players.
