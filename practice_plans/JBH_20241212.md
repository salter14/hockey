# Station Details

## Station 1 - Chris
Backwards and forwards transitions
- Players skate forwards to the first cone and transition to backwards
- Players skate backwards to the next cone and transition to forwards
- Repeat until the last cone
- Change direction to work the other transition direction after 5 minutes
- Coaching points: 
  - Players should face the same direction the whole time (face the benches side of the rink)
  - The transition to backwards should look like a hockey stop with the player's back facing the cone followed by a smooth switch to backwards skating (ideally with backwards crossovers)
  - The transition to forwards should be on the outside foot

## Station 2 - Ryan
Stops and starts
- Players go one at a time stopping at each cone.
- Players need to focus on making full stops with the appropiate foot. Coaches need to watch and enforce this.
- After the last cone, follow the path around the bumpers back to the line to stay out of the way of the drills.
- Switch to tight turns around the cones after 5 minutes.

## Station 3 - Ryan
Hard pass around the boards
- Player 1 starts on the boards near the bumper and sends a hard pass/shot around the boards to player 2, and then follows the puck up the wall.
- Player 2 receives the pass, skates around the tire, and drives the net for a shot.
- Player 1 takes the place of player 2.
- Player 2 returns to the line and the next player in line is now player 1.
- Coaching points:
  - HARD pass/shot around the boards from player 1. This was an issue at the tournament.
  - Player 1 should ensure they sweep the puck firmly, with it starting on their stick drawn back to near the back of their skate.

## Station 4 - Dave
Skate through the puck
- Player skates hard towards the coach with the puck.
- Player must keep their feet moving the whole time and not coast when nearing the puck/coach.
- The player should lead with their stick to knock the puck loose. If they miss or overskate the puck, they should stop hard, and battle to collect the puck.
- Once they have the puck, attack the net.

## Station 5 - Chris
Attack the puck carrier
- One player has the puck
- All other players should attack and try to take it
- Coaching points
  - The attacking players need to be agressive and put their stick on the puck, while getting their body between the player and the puck
