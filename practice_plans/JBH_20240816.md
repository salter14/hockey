# Station Details

## Station 1
Puck control, shoot, pass, shoot
1. The player skates with a puck through the cones.
1. After the last cone, the player drives to the net and takes a shot.
1. After the shot, the player curls back around the cone and gets a pass from the coach for a second shot.


## Station 2
Angling 1 on 1
1. Players start in two lines: one as defense and one as offense. Players should switch lines after each turn.
1. The forward skates with a puck to the board-side of the pad/cones and then down the boards to attack the net. Stopping, cutbacks, etc are encouraged.
1. The defense skates to the inside of the pad/cones and works to time his approach to the forward and angle the forward to the boards to prevent his path to the net. Stay with the player if they stop or cut back.
1. The defense cannot body check the player, but can use the body and stick to separate the puck from the forward.
1. If defense strips the puck from the forward, they should pass it back to the coach near the lines.  


## Station 3
Race around the cones
1. On whistle, players will skate forward to the far cone and make a tight turn, skate to the cone near the line and make a tight turn, and then skate around the far cone.
1. Coach pushes puck in. Players race to puck and shoot.
1. Depending on player skill, the players can skate backwards between the first and second turns.
