# Station Details

## Station 1
Corner battle
1. Coach dumps the puck in the corner, two players battle for possesion and the winner takes the puck to the net for a shot.
1. Encouarge use of the body to establish possession and protect the puck.

## Station 2
Angling 1 on 1
1. Players start in two lines: one as defense and one as offense. Players should switch lines after each turn.
1. The forward skates with a puck to the board-side of the pad and then down the boards to attack the net. Stopping, cutbacks, etc are encouraged.
1. The defense skates to the inside of the pad/cones and works to time his approach to the forward and angle the forward to the boards to prevent his path to the net. Stay with the player if they stop or cut back.
1. The defense cannot body check the player, but can use the body and stick to separate the puck from the forward. Using the body to block the path to the net is encouraged.
1. If defense strips the puck from the forward, they should pass it back to the coach near the lines.  

## Station 3
Tight Turns
1. The player starts without a puck and skates a tight loop around the first pad and then the second pad. The turning direction should be different for each pad to work turns in both directions. Coaches should encourage the players to stay close to the pads.
1. After the pads, the player goes past the cone and picks up a puck.
1. The player weaves through the remaining cones with tight turns and then shoots on net.
1. Coaching points:
   1. Tight turns with both skates on the ice, inside foot leading the outside foot.
   2. Stick and puck lead the player around the cones.
   3. Ensure players are using their backhand on turns as appropriate.

## Station 4
Race around the circles
1. On whistle, players will skate forward around the circle and then up to the cone near the blue line.
1. Coach pushes puck in. Players race to puck and shoot.
1. Coach should encourage use of cross overs to build speed around the circles.
1. Variant: Depending on player skill, the players can skate backwards until they get to the cone.
