# Station Details

## Station 1 - Ryan
Fox Hunt
- One player has a puck and the others do not.
- All players skate in an oval around the bumpers.
- The player with the puck attempts to make two full laps before being caught.
- If a player without the puck catches up to the puck carrier the race is over.


## Station 2 - Paul
Tight Turns
1. The player carries a puck and skates a tight loop around the first pad and then the second pad. The turning direction should be different for each pad to work turns in both directions. Coaches should encourage the players to stay close to the pads.
1. After the pads, the player passes the puck to the coach and then goes around the tire/cone.
1. Coach passes the puck back to the player.
1. The player weaves through the remaining cones with tight turns and then shoots on net.
1. Coaching points:
   1. Tight turns with both skates on the ice, inside foot leading the outside foot.
   2. Stick and puck lead the player around the cones.
   3. Ensure players are using their backhand on turns as appropriate.

## Station 3 - Josh
Puck race with pass

- Player passes the puck to the next player in line, and then recieves a return pass.
- After receivint the return pass, the player skates around the cone near the blue line and back to the line.
- The next player goes and repeats the above steps until the whole team has gone. First team done wins.
- Each team should only have one puck available to them to ensure good passes are made. If the pass is off the mark, they need to retrieve the puck.

## Station 4 - Chris
1-on-1
- Offense carries the puck around the tire and attacks the net.
- Defense mirrors offense and transitions to backwards around the cone to defend.

## Station 5 - Dave
2-on-1 dumped puck
- Two forwards and one defense go at a time.
- Coach dumps the puck into the left or right corner. The player to that side goes after the puck and the other player goes to the net.
- Defense should attack the puck and try to prevent a goal. If they get the puck, pass it back to the coach.
- The forwards should work together to score. The player that goes to the puck should make a pass to the front of the net and then follow it for a rebound chance.
