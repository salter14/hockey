# Station Details

## Station 1
Puck control, shoot, pass, shoot
1. The player skates with a puck through the cones.
1. After the last cone, the player drives to the net and takes a shot.
1. After the shot, the player curls back around the cone and gets a pass from the coach for a second shot.


## Station 2
Angling 1 on 1
1. Players start in two lines: one as defense and one as offense. Players should switch lines after each turn.
1. The forward skates with a puck to the board-side of the pad/cones and then down the boards to attack the net. Stopping, cutbacks, etc are encouraged.
1. The defense skates to the inside of the pad/cones and works to time his approach to the forward and angle the forward to the boards to prevent his path to the net. Stay with the player if they stop or cut back.
1. The defense cannot body check the player, but can use the body and stick to separate the puck from the forward.
1. If defense strips the puck from the forward, they should pass it back to the coach near the lines.  


## Station 3
Race around the cones
1. On whistle, players will skate forward to the far cone and make a tight turn, skate to the cone near the line and make a tight turn, and then skate around the far cone.
1. Coach pushes puck in. Players race to puck and shoot.
1. Depending on player skill, the players can skate backwards between the first and second turns.

## Station 4
Small area scrimmage
1. 3v3 scrimmage with mini nets (the really small ones).
1. Coaches should encourage players to spread out and pass the puck.
1. Coaches should not allow the players to "play goalie". Keep them from camping out in fron of their net.
1. If the group is short a player, the coach can play for one team.


## Station 5
Shooting and Passing

Passing:
1. Players can pass with each other or with a coach.
1. Coaches should encourage flat, smooth passes to the other player's stick. Players should cup and sweep the puck, not jab at it in front of them.
1. Players receiving the puck should have their stick on the ice to give the other player a target. When receiving the puck, cushion and cup it to make it easier to control.

Shooting:
1. Players should shoot at the boards while stationary.
1. All shots should be wrist shots. Don't slap at the puck.
1. Coaches should ensure the players bring the puck back a bit so they don't jab at it on front of them. 


## Skating Drills (full ice)
- Two strides and crouch to touch the ice, repeat all the way down the ice
- Knee downs on each stride
- c-cuts right
- c-cuts left
- glide on one leg between the blue line, carve back and forth if you can
- cross overs (just step across, not a turn)
- backwards c-cuts
- red light / green light
