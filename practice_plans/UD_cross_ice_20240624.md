### Puck race with stops

Players race to the top cone and stop, down to the lower cone and stop, then skate back up and around the top cone and race for a puck in the middle. Players should focus on making a full stop and exploding the other direction. Don't let players cheat by making sharp turns. Players should stop facing the middle at each cone.
