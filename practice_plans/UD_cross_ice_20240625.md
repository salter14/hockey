![image](https://github.com/salter14/hockey/blob/main/drill_diagrams/Puck_race_1v1_with_stops.png)

Players race to the top cone and stop, down to the lower cone and stop, then skate back up and around the top cone and race for a puck in the middle. Players should focus on making a full stop and exploding the other direction. Don't let players cheat by making sharp turns. Players should stop facing the middle at each cone.

## Station 4 and 5
Instructional scrimage (2 groups at a time)
