# Station Details
## Station 1 - Ryan/Pete
Race
- Players skate through the tires/cones. Next player goes when the first gets back to the line.
- Iteration: no pucks, pucks, backwards

## Station 2 - Chris/Dave
Stops and starts
- Players go one at a time stopping at each cone.
- Players need to focus on making full stops with the appropiate foot. Coaches need to watch and enforce this.
- After the last cone, follow the path around the bumpers back to the line to stay out of the way of the drills.
- Switch to tight turns around the cones after 5 minutes.

## Station 3 - Ryan/Pete
1. The player carries a puck and skates a tight loop around the first pad and then the second pad. The turning direction should be different for each pad to work turns in both directions. Coaches should encourage the players to stay close to the pads.
1. After the pads, the player passes the puck to the coach and then goes around the tire/cone.
1. The player skates without the puck to the far tire/cone and then gets a return pass from the coach.
1. The player weaves through the remaining cones with tight turns and then shoots on net.
1. Coaching points:
   1. Tight turns with both skates on the ice, inside foot leading the outside foot.
   2. Stick and puck lead the player around the cones.
   3. Ensure players are using their backhand on turns as appropriate.

## Station 4 - Chris
- Two forwards and one defense battle in a loose puck situation in front of the goalie.
- The goalie should start the drill in the butterfly, and the coach begins the drill by either lightly shooting the puck at one of the goalie's pads or simply dropping it in front of the goalie.
- The two forwards attempt to score.
- The goalie attempts to cover the puck and the defense helps the goalie by tieing up the forward or clearing the puck.
- The defense should also protect the goalie if they are able to cover the puck.


## Station 5 - Dave
Keep-away or Puck Possession battle

Keep away
-Designate one player as "it".
-The other players attempt to keep the puck away from the "it" player.
-The players should spread out and pass the puck. The pads are there to keep the playing area constrained.
-When the "it" player gets possession of the puck, they join the other players and another player is named "it".
-If the "it" doesn't gain possession after a minute or so, switch the "it" player.

Puck Possession Battle
1. Game is played with fewer pucks than players (e.g. 6 players and 4 pucks).
2. Players are confined to the game area and seek to get and keep a puck from the other players.
3. Coach starts a round and players battle for pucks and take them from other players.
4. Rounds last 30-60 seconds (adjust as needed for skill/ability).
5. At the end of the round, any player with out a puck is out, and the next round starts with fewer players and pucks.
6. The player with the puck in the last round is the winner.
7. All players rejoin the game and it starts again.
