# Station Details

## Station 1 - Brett
Angling
- Two players go at a time
- Forward carry the puck along with wall and attempt to get to the net. 
- Defense skates backwards and angles the player with the puck to keep them to the outside. Defense should try to take the puck and carry or pass it back to the coach/player lines.
- Coaching points:
  - Forwards should protect the puck with their body. Encourage leaning into the defensive player to drive the net or use cut backs.
  - Defense should stay with the forward and use an acitve stick and their body to separate the puck.
  - For younger players, the defense can skate forwards instead of backwards.

## Station 2 - Josh
Pass and shoot
- Player at the frone of the line skates around the top of the circle, receives a pass from the second player in line, and shoots.
- Coaching points: Passes should be flat on the ice and should lead the player. The player receiving the pass should have their stick ready to show the passer where they want the pass.
- For younger player groups, this may be difficult. The coach can provide a backup pass if the one from the line does not work out.

## Station 3 - Chris L.
Skating skills and edges
- Two lines of players will do the same movements through the cones. Higher-skilled players can do these with pucks. Lower skilled players should go without pucks and focus on their footwork.
- Variations:
    1. Forward the whole way: Around cone 2, cone 1, cone 3, cone 2, cone 4, cone 3, to the boards to line up
    2. Forward to cone 2, backward to cone 1, forward to cone 3, backward to cone 2, forward to cone 4, backward to cone 3, to boards to line up.
    3. Stops: cone 2, cone 1, cone 3, cone 2, cone 4, cone 3, boards to line up.
- Run each variation twice (benches to stands, stands to benches) so the players make the turns both directions.
- Coaching points:
    - For less skilled players, focus on footwork. Turns should be tight, both feet on the ice, and lead with the inside foot on the outside edge. Pivots to backwards should work like a stop with the player's back to the cone with a continual motion to backwards. Stops should be facing the correct direction and with two feet.
    - Higher skilled players do the drill with a puck, should be doing all the things listed above, as well as leading with the stick and puck around the cones when turning forwards. Focus on puck control while still using the correct footwork.

## Station 4 - Lorne
Fox Hunt
- One player has a puck and the others do not.
- All players skate in an oval around the bumpers.
- The player with the puck attempts to make two full laps before being caught.
- If a player without the puck catches up to the puck carrier the race is over.

## Station 5 - Chris S.
Small area puck possession game
1. Game is played with fewer pucks than players (e.g. 6 players and 4 pucks).
2. Players are confined to the game area and seek to get and keep a puck from the other players.
3. Coach starts a round and players battle for pucks and take them from other players.
4. Rounds last 30-60 seconds (adjust as needed for skill/ability).
5. At the end of the round, any player with out a puck is out, and the next round starts with fewer players and pucks.
6. The player with the puck in the last round is the winner.
7. All players rejoin the game and it starts again.
