# Station Details

## Station 1
Angling 1 on 1
1. Players start in two lines: one as defense and one as offense. Players should switch lines after each turn.
1. The forward skates with a puck to the board-side of the pad/cones and then down the boards to attack the net.
1. The defense skates to the inside of the pad/cones and works to time his approach to the forward and angle the forward to the boards to prevent his path to the net.
1. The defense cannot body check the player, but can use the body and stick to separate the puck from the forward.
1. If defense strips the puck from the forward, they should pass it back to the coach near the lines.  


## Station 2
Puck control, shoot, pass, shoot

1. The player skates with a puck through the cones. 
1. After the last cone, the player drives to the net and takes a shot. 
1. After the shot, the player curls back around the cone and gets a pass from the coach for a second shot.


## Station 3
Skating
1. Crossovers around the circle, one way then the other
2. Backwards around the circle (cross overs if they can)
3. Red light, green light (forwards and backwards)


## Station 4
Race for the puck
1. Players race around the cones in a Z pattern and then battle for the puck and a shot.
1. Players need to keep their heads up going through the middle intersection.
