# Station Details
## NOTE: Station 1 and 2 will be run, then we will switch to stations 3, 4, and 5.

## Station 1 - Ryan and Lina
Fox Hunt
- One player has a puck and the others do not.
- All players skate in an oval around the bumpers.
- The player with the puck attempts to make two full laps before being caught.
- If a player without the puck catches up to the puck carrier the race is over.

## Station 2 - Chris and Dave
Stops and starts
- Players go one at a time stopping at each cone.
- Players need to focus on making full stops with the appropiate foot. Coaches need to watch and enforce this.
- After the last cone, follow the path around the bumpers back to the line to stay out of the way of the drills.

## Station 3 - Ryan
Attack the player with the puck
- One player starts in the corner with a puck and tries to get to the net to score.
- The other player starts near the face off dot and attacks the player to keep them from going to the net and to get the puck. If they get the puck, pass it to the coach.
- Coaching points: The defensive player needs to attack quickly and not give the player with the puck time to think and react. If the defensive player stops and stares at the player with the puck, the coach needs to address it.

## Station 4 - Dave
2-on-1 dumped puck
- Two forwards and one defense go at a time.
- Coach dumps the puck into the left or right corner. The player to that side goes after the puck and the other player goes to the net.
- Defense should attack the puck and try to prevent a goal. If they get the puck, pass it back to the coach.
- The forwards should work together to score. The player that goes to the puck should make a pass to the front of the net and then follow it for a rebound chance.
- Coaching points: This is an evolution of the 1-on-1 drill from prior practices. If 2-on-1 doesn't work out well, revert to the 1-on-1.

## Station 5 - Chris/Lina
Shooting and passing
