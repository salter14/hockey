# Station Details

## Station 1 - Chris
Crossovers
- Players skate a full lap around the first circle then a full lap around the second circle.
- Switch to backwards after 5 minutes.
- Coaching points
    - Ensure players are crossing over to generate speed while going around the circle

## Station 2 - Pete
Backwards and forwards transitions
- Players skate towards the first cone. Halfway there, they will transition to backwards.
- Go around the cone backwards and toward the next cone. Transition to forward halfway to the cone.
- The cycle repeats.

## Station 3 - Pete
Skating with the puck with speed
- The player passes the puck to the coach, then skates hard at the coach to strip the puck.
- The player gathers the loose puck and then skates hard down the boards, makes a hard turn around the tire to the net and shoots.
- Coaching points
  - Skate fast with the puck by using one hand on the stick
  - If the initial poke check of the puck does not knock it loose, the player should stop and battle to take it.

## Station 4 - Chris
Backwards skating on defense
- One player is defense and one is offense.
- The offensive player skates with the puck behind the pad and then tries to get to the net.
- The defensive player should start ahead of the offensive player and must skate backwards.
- The defense should skate backwards and try to knock the puck away and keep the player to the outside.
- The defense should transition to forward if the offensive player is going to skate past them.
- Coaching points
    - Skating backwards instead of skating at the player with the puck prevents easy breakaways by staying with the offensive player
    - Help players with proper positioning on defense when the puck is in the opponent's end of the ice. Our defense often stays too far back in our end.
