# Station Details

## Station 1 - Chris S
2v2 back-to-back nets
- 2v2 small area scrimmage, but players may not cross the middle line
- One player from each team on each side of the ice (a forward from one team, and a defense from the other team)
- Play shot intervals (30 seconds to a minute), then switch the players on offense and defense so each player takes a turn at both
- Extra players stand on the blue line and keep the puck in the playing area or can be "goalies" for the smaller players. Rotate players in and out.

## Station 2 - Lorne
Relay Race
- Players line up in 2 lines (2 teams) on the goal line.
- Every player has one puck in each hand.  First player from each team skates as hard as they can to the blue line, stacks their 2 pucks on the blue line, and then skate as fast as they can back to the goal line and must tag the next player in line.  Once tagged, the next player in line player skates to the blue line and continues to build the puck tower, and then returns to the goal line to tag the next player in line.  If the puck tower falls, the active skater must rebuild the puck tower before they can return to the goal line to tag the next player in line.  First time to complete the race wins.
- First Heat - Players Skate Forwards the entire time
- Second Heat - Players skate forwards to the blue line, and backwards back to the goal line
- Third Heat - Players skate backwards the entire time

## Station 3 - Josh
- Player skates along the left side of the bumper and makes pass to coach standing on goal line.
- Once they reach the end of the bumper, turn towards the boards and open up to receive a breakout pass back from Coach.
- Player receives the pass, skates to the second pad, makes a tight turn towards the net, and takes a shot.

## Station 4 - Brett
- Player skates to the left side of the bumper and passes to the coach.
- Player skates backwards on the right side of the bumper, then turns forward when they reach the end.
- Coach passes back to the player, who carries the puck through the cones and shoots.

## Station 5 - Paul
- Player skates with the puck to the top of the bumper on the left side, then skates backwards with the puck along the right side.
- Player turns forwards and skates to the right side of the next bumper and passes to the coach.
- Player skates backwards to the end of the bumper, then forwards towards the net.
- Coach passes and the player receives and shoots in a smooth motion (not a one-timer).

## Station 6 - Chris L
2-on-1 dumped puck
- Two forwards and one defense go at a time.
- Coach dumps the puck into the left or right corner. The player to that side goes after the puck and the other player goes to the net or supports the other player.
- Defense should attack the puck and try to prevent a goal. If they get the puck, pass it back to the coach.
- The forwards should work together to score. The player that goes to the puck should make a pass to the front of the net and then follow it for a rebound chance.
