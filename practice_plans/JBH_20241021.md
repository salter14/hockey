# Station Details

## Station 1 - Dave
2-on-1 dumped puck
- Two forwards and one defense go at a time.
- Coach dumps the puck into the left or right corner. The player to that side goes after the puck and the other player goes to the net.
- Defense should attack the puck and try to prevent a goal. If they get the puck, pass it back to the coach.
- The forwards should work together to score. The player that goes to the puck should make a pass to the front of the net and then follow it for a rebound chance.
- Coaching points: This is an evolution of the 1-on-1 drill from prior practices. If 2-on-1 doesn't work out well, revert to the 1-on-1.

## Station 2 - Ryan
Puck race
- The coach pushes a puck towards the far blue line and the first two players in each line race for it and a shot on net.
- Coaching points:
    - Players need to be paired appropriately to keep the race competative. If equal pairings are not available, let the slower player start from a few feet ahead, or make the faster player start from lying on the ice.
    - The focus here is quick acceleration to full speed. There should not be a long puck battle, just a foot race for a break away.
    - The player that gets to the puck first should use their body to keep the other player behind them. Forward progress the whole time. If the race stops moving forward, kill the run and send the next group.

## Station 3 - Chris
Skate and pass
- The player skates with a puck around the tire and then does a give-and-go pass with the coach. 
- Once receiving the return pass, the player drives down the boards and makes a pass to the player in front of the net for a shot. The player should also follow the pass to the net for a rebound chance.
- The player that just skated and passed takes the place of the player in front of the net.
- Coaching points:
    - Players should be properly positioned in front of the net and ready for the pass and a quick shot.
    - The passer should look to the net to identify where the pass should go before they reach the end of the bumper.


## Station 4 - Pete or Mike
Pass and shoot
- Player at the frone of the line skates around the top of the circle, receives a pass from the second player in line, and shoots.
- Coaching points: Passes should be flat on the ice and should lead the player. The player receiving the pass should have their stick ready to show the passer where they want the pass.
- For younger player groups, this may be difficult. The coach can provide a backup pass if the one from the line does not work out.
