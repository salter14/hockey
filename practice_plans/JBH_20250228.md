# Station Details

## Station 1 - Pete
Backwards and forwards transitions
- Players skate towards the first cone. Halfway there, they will transition to backwards.
- Go around the cone backwards and toward the next cone. Transition to forward halfway to the cone.
- The cycle repeats.

## Station 2 - Chris
Fox Hunt
- Player with the puck must skate two laps around the nets without be caught by the other players.

## Station 3 - Dave
Angling
- Offensive player takes the puck and skates behind the pad and then down the boards with speed.
- Defense attacks the puck carrier by angling them and keeping them to the outside before taking away their space along the boards.
- Coaching points
    - Offense should use speed to try and get past the defense.
    - Defense needs to work on angle, timing, and gap to ensure the puck carrier is taken to the boards and does not drive the net.

## Station 4 - Pete
Hard pass around the boards
- Player 1 starts on the boards near the bumper and sends a hard pass/shot around the boards to player 2, and then follows the puck up the wall quickly.
- Player 2 receives the pass, makes a self-pass off the boards around the tire, skates around the other tire, and drives the net for a shot.
- Player 1 takes the place of player 2.
- Player 2 returns to the line and the next player in line is now player 1.
- Coaching points:
  - HARD pass/shot around the boards from player 1. This was an issue at the tournament.
  - Player 1 should ensure they sweep the puck firmly, with it starting on their stick drawn back to near the back of their skate.
  - Player 1 should yell the name of player 2 before sending the puck.

## Station 5 - Chris
Rebounds
- Coach shoots the puck at the net
- Two players go for the rebound and try to score
