# Station Details

## Station 1 - Ryan
- Two lines of players, one from each line goes at the same time.
- Coach dumps the puck into the left or right corner. The player to that side goes after the puck and the other player goes to the net.
- The player going after the puck obtains possession and passes to the player in front, then goes to the net.
- The player in front gets the pass and takes a shot.
- Coaching points: The idea is for players to learn that they should go after the puck if they are the closest player and the other player should go to the net. Teach the player in front where to go (not too close to the goalie).


## Station 2 - Dave
- Two lines of players: one defense, one offense.
- Coach dumps the puck to the left or right side.
- The forward gets a head start and chases the puck, then attempts to get to the net.
- The defense needs to pursue the other player and try to anticipate which way to attack.
- Coaching points: Both players should be skating top speed to get the puck or pressure the player. The defensive player needs to anticipate what the player with the puck will do.


## Station 3 - Chris and Lina
Shooting and passing
