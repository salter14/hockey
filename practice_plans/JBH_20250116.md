# Station Details

## Station 1 - Pete
Backwards and forwards transitions
- Players skate forwards to the first cone and transition to backwards
- Players skate backwards to the next cone and transition to forwards
- Repeat until the last cone
- Change direction to work the other transition direction after 5 minutes
- Coaching points: 
  - Players should face the same direction the whole time (face the benches side of the rink)
  - The transition to backwards should look like a hockey stop with the player's back facing the cone followed by a smooth switch to backwards skating (ideally with backwards crossovers)
  - The transition to forwards should be on the outside foot

## Station 2 - Chris
Stops and starts
- Players go one at a time stopping at each cone.
- Players need to focus on making full stops with the appropiate foot. Coaches need to watch and enforce this.
- After the last cone, follow the path around the bumpers back to the line to stay out of the way of the drills.
- Switch to tight turns around the cones after 5 minutes.

## Station 3 - Pete
Loose puck race
- Two players go at a time. One is designated as trying to score and the other is assigned to return the puck to the coach. Switch player roles each iteration.
- Coach dumps the puck to a random place in the playing area and the players race for the puck and battle.
- If the player returning the puck to the coach sends a wild, off target pass, coach should put the puck back in play for the battle to continue.
- Stop the battle after 15-20 seconds if no one wins.
- Coaching points
  - The key here is to pursue the puck with speed.
  - If there will be a clear winner in the initial race to the puck, the second player should still be pursuing as fast as possible to prevent the winner from having time to gather the puck.

## Station 4 - Dave
Attack the puck
- Player with the puck skates around the net
- Attacking player attempts to disrupt and steal the puck
- The player should lead with their stick to knock the puck loose. If they miss or overskate the puck, they should stop hard, and battle to collect the puck.
- If they win the puck, attack the net.

## Station 5 - Chris
Skating with the puck with speed
- The first player gathers the puck and then skates with one hand on the stick with the puck along the boards
- The second player goes to the net for a pass
- The puck carrier passes to the player in front once they get past the tire. The can optionally skate behind the net and then pass.
- Coaching points
  - Skate fast with the puck by using one hand on the stick
  - Gather the puck while moving to maintain speed
