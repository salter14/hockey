# Station Details

## Station 1 - Chris
Backwards and forwards transitions
- Players skate towards the first cone. Halfway there, they will transition to backwards.
- Go around the cone backwards and toward the next cone. Transition to forward halfway to the cone.
- The cycle repeats.

## Station 2 - Pete/Dave
Tight turns, then stops and starts with pucks
- Players skate through the cones making tight turngs. Focus on the inside foot being out in front and on its outside edge. The play should lead with their stick around the cone in front of them.
- After 3-5 mintues, switch to stops and starts with the puck.
  - Players go one at a time stopping at each cone.
  - Players need to focus on making full stops with the appropiate foot. Coaches need to watch and enforce this.
  - After the last cone, follow the path around the bumpers back to the line to stay out of the way of the drills.

## Station 3 - Chris
Hard pass around the boards
- Player 1 starts on the boards near the bumper and sends a hard pass/shot around the boards to player 2, and then follows the puck up the wall.
- Player 2 receives the pass, skates around the tire, and drives the net for a shot.
- Player 1 takes the place of player 2.
- Player 2 returns to the line and the next player in line is now player 1.
- Coaching points:
  - HARD pass/shot around the boards from player 1. This was an issue at the tournament.
  - Player 1 should ensure they sweep the puck firmly, with it starting on their stick drawn back to near the back of their skate.

## Station 4 - Dave
Backwards skating on defense
- One player is defense and one is offense.
- The defensive player should start ahead of the offensive player and must start skating backwards.
- The offensive player skates with the puck and tries to get to the net.
- The defense should skate backwards and try to knock the puck away and keep the player to the outside.
- The defense should transition to forward if the offensive player is going to skate past them.

## Station 5 - Pete
Skating with the puck with speed
- The player passes the puck to the coach, then skates hard at the coach to strip the puck.
- The player gathers the loose puck and then skates hard down the boards, makes a hard turn around the tire to the net and shoots.
- Coaching points
  - Skate fast with the puck by using one hand on the stick
  - If the initial poke check of the puck does not knock it loose, the player should stop and battle to take it.
