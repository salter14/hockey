# Station Details

## Station 1 - Ryan
Pass and shoot
- Player at the frone of the line skates around the top of the circle, receives a pass from the second player in line, and shoots.
- Coaching points: Passes should be flat on the ice and should lead the player. The player receiving the pass should have their stick ready to show the passer where they want the pass.
- For younger player groups, this may be difficult. The coach can provide a backup pass if the one from the line does not work out.

## Station 2 - Josh
Read the defenseman
- Players crisscross and drive the net. The player with the puck needs to read the coach playing defense and pass or shoot.
- Both players should drive the net regardless of what the coach does on defense. 

## Station 3 - Brett
Tight Turns
1. The player starts without a puck and skates a tight loop around the first pad and then the second pad. The turning direction should be different for each pad to work turns in both directions. Coaches should encourage the players to stay close to the pads.
1. After the pads, the player goes past the cone and picks up a puck.
1. The player weaves through the remaining cones with tight turns and then shoots on net.
1. Coaching points:
   1. Tight turns with both skates on the ice, inside foot leading the outside foot.
   2. Stick and puck lead the player around the cones.
   3. Ensure players are using their backhand on turns as appropriate.

## Station 4 - Lina
Small area puck possession game
1. Game is played with fewer pucks than players (e.g. 6 players and 4 pucks).
2. Players are confined to the game area and seek to get and keep a puck from the other players.
3. Coach starts a round and players battle for pucks and take them from other players.
4. Rounds last 30-60 seconds (adjust as needed for skill/ability).
5. At the end of the round, any player with out a puck is out, and the next round starts with fewer players and pucks.
6. The player with the puck in the last round is the winner.
7. All players rejoin the game and it starts again.

## Station 5 - Lorne
Fox Hunt
- One player has a puck and the others do not.
- All players skate in an oval around the bumpers.
- The player with the puck attempts to make two full laps before being caught.
- If a player without the puck catches up to the puck carrier the race is over.
