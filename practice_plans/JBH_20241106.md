# Station Details
## NOTE: Station 1 and 2 will be run, then we will switch to stations 3, 4, and 5.

## Station 1 - Ryan and Pete
Skating race
- Two teams race eachother.
- The players skate backwards to the tire, then transition to forward as the go around it and skate forward back to the line.
- Run this version 2-3 times, then run this version:
  - The players skate forward with a puck to the tire, go around, then back to the line.

## Station 2 - Chris and Dave
Stops and starts
- Players go one at a time stopping at each cone.
- Players need to focus on making full stops with the appropiate foot. Coaches need to watch and enforce this.
- After the last cone, follow the path around the bumpers back to the line to stay out of the way of the drills.
- Switch to tight turns around the cones after 5 minutes.

## Station 3 - Ryan
Net front battle
- Two forwards and one defense battle in a loose puck situation in front of the goalie.
- The goalie should start the drill in the butterfly, and the coach begins the drill by either lightly shooting the puck at one of the goalie's pads or simply dropping it in front of the goalie.
- The two forwards attempt to score.
- The goalie attempts to cover the puck and the defense helps the goalie by tieing up the forward or clearing the puck.
- The defense should also protect the goalie if they are able to cover the puck.

## Station 4 - Dave
2-on-0 dumped puck
- Two lines of players, one from each line goes at the same time.
- Coach dumps the puck into the left or right corner. The player to that side goes after the puck and the other player goes to the net.
- The player going after the puck obtains possession and passes to the player in front, then goes to the net.
- The player in front gets the pass and takes a shot.
- Coaching points: The idea is for players to learn that they should go after the puck if they are the closest player and the other player should go to the net. Teach the player in front where to go (not too close to the goalie).
- Switch to 2-on-1 if needed.

## Station 5 - Chris and Pete
Collecting the puck at speed
- Player skates with speed around the pad while coach puts a puck in the corner.
- The player needs to pick up the puck with speed and then attack the net.
- Optional defenseman will work on skating backwards as the player attacks. This will help defense understand how far up to move when the puck is deep in the other team's end during a game.
- Coach may play defense if needed.
