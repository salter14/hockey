# Station Details

## Station 1 - Chris
Tight turns, then stops and starts with pucks
- Players skate through the cones making tight turngs. Focus on the inside foot being out in front and on its outside edge. The play should lead with their stick around the cone in front of them.
- After 3-5 mintues, switch to stops and starts with the puck.
  - Players go one at a time stopping at each cone.
  - Players need to focus on making full stops with the appropiate foot. Coaches need to watch and enforce this.
  - After the last cone, follow the path around the bumpers back to the line to stay out of the way of the drills.

## Station 2 - Pete
Backwards and forwards transitions
- Players skate towards the first cone. Halfway there, they will transition to backwards.
- Go around the cone backwards and toward the next cone. Transition to forward halfway to the cone.
- The cycle repeats.

## Station 3 - Chris
Small area 3v3

## Station 4 - Pete
Pass and shoot
- Player skates without a puck around the tires in an arch towards the net
- The next player in line passes the puck to the player after the second tire
- Player recieves the pass and shoots
- Coaching points:
  - The pass should lead the player so it isn't behing them, forcing the player to stop
  - The player receiving the pass should have their stick on the ice where they want the pass
