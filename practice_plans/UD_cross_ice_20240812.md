# Station Details

## Station 1
Fastest skater
Option #1 - timed
1. Players skate one at a time and are timed from the staring line to the finish

Option #2 - head-to-head
1. Two players skate at a time (one group of 3 if there is an odd number). First to the finish wins.
2. Races continue until the group produces a winner.
3. Winners from each group will return to compete against each other.

## Station 2
Passing accuracy
1. Players have 60 seconds and 15 pucks to pass to a mini net. Most pucks in the net wins.
2. If there is a tie once all players have gone, the tied players will go again for 30 seconds each.

## Station 3
Break away competition
1. Players attempt to score on the goalie.
2. Each player has 60 seconds and unlimited pucks.
3. First shot only, no rebounds.
4. If there is a tie once all players have gone, the tied players will go again for 30 seconds each.
