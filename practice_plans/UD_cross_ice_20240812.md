# Station Details

## Station 1
Fastest skater
Option #1 - timed
1. Players skate one at a time and are timed from the staring line to the finish
Winning criteria: Lowest time

Option #2 - head-to-head
1. Two players skate at a time (one group of 3 if there is an odd number). First to the finish wins.
2. Races continue until the group produces a winner.
3. Winners from each group will return to compete against each other.
Winning criteria: First to cross the finish line

## Station 2

2. If there is a tie once all players in the group have gone, the tied players will go again for 30 seconds each.
Winning criteria: Most pucks to go in the mini net in the alloted time (pucks do not have to stay in the net)

## Station 3
Break away competition
1. Players attempt to score on the goalie.
2. Each player has 60 seconds and unlimited pucks.

## Station 4
Hardest shot (if we can find a radar gun)

2. Player must be stationary when shooting.
Winning criteria: Fastest shot speed
