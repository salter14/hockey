# Station Details

## Station 1
Breakout
- Demonstrate the positions and roles for each player.
- Keep the puck away from the front of the net.


## Station 2
Puck battle (littles) - Dave
- Teaching the smaller players to be more aggressive battling for the puck and using the body to create separation or to protect the puck.


## Station 3
Covering and clearing the front of the net (bigs) - Lina/Ryan

Teaching points:
- Coach should demonstrate how to cover a player (stay close, lift the stick when the puck is near or on the way). Show the offensive player how to get open and avoid being tied up.
- Coach should also demonstrate how to tie up and clear a player when the goalie is trying to cover the puck. Don't let the offensive player get his stick on the puck or the goalie. Lift the sick and push the player away. 

Drill:
- One defensive player and one offensive player in front of the goalie.
- Coach passes the puck to the offensive player. Defense should try to cover the player, tie them up, and let the goalie cover the puck. Offense should attempt to score.
