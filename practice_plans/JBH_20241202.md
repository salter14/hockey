# Station Details

## Goalie Station: Chris S.

## Station 1 - Pete
Small area puck possession game
1. Game is played with fewer pucks than players (e.g. 6 players and 4 pucks).
2. Players are confined to the game area and seek to get and keep a puck from the other players.
3. Coach starts a round and players battle for pucks and take them from other players.
4. Rounds last 30-60 seconds (adjust as needed for skill/ability).
5. At the end of the round, any player with out a puck is out, and the next round starts with fewer players and pucks.
6. The player with the puck in the last round is the winner.
7. All players rejoin the game and it starts again.

## Station 2 - Josh C.
- Player skates with the puck to the top of the bumper on the left side, then skates backwards with the puck along the right side.
- Player turns forwards and skates to the right side of the next bumper and passes to the coach.
- Player skates backwards to the end of the bumper, then forwards towards the net.
- Coach passes and the player receives and shoots in a smooth motion (not a one-timer).

## Station 3 - Ben
- Player makes a pass to coach and receives a pass back.
- Player skates with the puck around the bumper, then through the cones, and takes a shot on net.

## Station 4 - Lorne
Relay Race:  
- Players line up in 2 lines (2 teams) on the goal line.  Every player has one puck in each hand.
- First player from each team skates as hard as they can through the cones to the blue line, stacks their 2 pucks on the blue line next to the cone, and then skates as fast as they can back through the cones to the goal line and must tag the next player in line.
- Once tagged, the next player in line player skates to the blue line and continues to build the puck tower, and then returns to the goal line to tag the next player in line.
- If the puck tower falls, the active skater must rebuild the puck tower before they can return to the goal line to tag the next player in line.  First time to complete the race wins.
- Iterations:
  - First Heat - Players Skate Forwards the entire time
  - Second Heat - Players skate forwards to the blue line, and backwards back to the goal line
  - Third Heat - Players skate backwards the entire time

## Station 5 - Chris L.
1-on-1
- Offense carries the puck around the tire and attacks the net.
- Defense mirrors offense and transitions to backwards around the cone to defend.
- Defense should work on timing the turn to ensure a tight gap with the other player. Stick should be active. Keep the player to the outside. Don't lunge forward.
- Coach can skate behind the offensive player to apply back pressure and encourage the offense to attack with speed.

## Station 6 - Paul
- Player makes pass to coach standing on goal line and skates along the inside of the bumper.
- Once they reach the end of the bumper, turn towards the boards and open up to receive a breakout pass back from Coach.
- Player receives the pass, skates to the second pad, makes a tight turn towards the net, and takes a shot.
