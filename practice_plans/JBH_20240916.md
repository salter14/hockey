# Station Details
## Station 1 - Ryan - Tight turns with the puck 
- Players skate with a puck through the cones.
- After the cones, drive the net and take a shot.
- Curl around the cone and recieve a pass from the coach for a second shot.
- Coaching points: Ensure players are using their backhand when going around the cones to that side. Players should make tight turns around the cones, leading with the puck, keeping both feet on the ice with the inside leg leading on the outside edge.

## Station 2 - Josh - Angling
- Two players go at a time
- Forward carry the puck along with wall and attempt to get to the net. 
- Defense angles the player with the puck and tries to keep them to the outside. Defense should try to take the puck and carry or pass it back to the coach/player lines.
- Coaching points: Forwards should protect the puck with their body. Encourage leaning into the defensive player to drive the net or use cut backs. Defense should stay with the forward and use an acitve stick and their body to separate the puck.

## Station 3 - Lina - Skating skills
- Two lines of players will do the same movements through the cones. Higher-skilled players can do these with pucks. Lower skilled players should go without pucks and focus on their footwork.
- Variations:
    1. Forward the whole way: Around cone 2, cone 1, cone 3, cone 2, cone 4, cone 3, to the boards to line up
    2. Forward to cone 2, backward to cone 1, forward to cone 3, backward to cone 2, forward to cone 4, backward to cone 3, to boards to line up.
    3. Stops: cone 2, cone 1, cone 3, cone 2, cone 4, cone 3, boards to line up.
- Run each variation twice so the players make the turns both directions.
- Coaching points:
    - For less skilled players, focus on footwork. Turns should be tight, both feet on the ice, and lead with the inside foot on the outside edge. Pivots to backwards should work like a stop with the player's back to the cone with a continual motion to backwards. Stops should be facing the correct direction and with two feet.
    - Higher skilled player with the puck should be doing all the things listed above, as well as leading with the stick and puck around the cones when turning forwards. Focus on puck control while still using the correct footwork.

## Station 4 - Brett - Breakout pass and support
- Players skate behind the net with a puck and pass to the coach on the boards.
- The coach has three options: receive the pass and pass back to the player, recieve the pass and push it up the boards, don't receive the pass and let the puck go through.
- The player needs to be ready for the return pass but also be preparred to go after the puck on the wall if the coach lets the pass through or pushes it up the wall. This simulates the game breakout where the player on the wall may not be able to make a pass and the original player may need to swoop in to support and pick up the puck.
- After receiving the pass or retrieving the puck from the wall, the player goes arount the cone and drives the net for a shot.
- Coaching points: The player needs to be in position for a return pass but also reading the play to determine if they need to alter their route to the boards to retreive the puck. 

## Station 5 - Lorne - Small area battle
- Two players battle for the puck and attmpt to score.
- Players should focus on using their body to establish possession and protect the puck.
- Coaching points: Help players understand the putting their body between the other player and the puck prevents the other player from being able to reach it. Turning away from the attacking player keeps their body in the right position to protect the puck.
