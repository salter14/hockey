# Station Details
## Station 1 - Ryan - Tight turns with the puck 
- Players skate with a puck through the cones.
- After the cones, drive the net and take a shot.
- Curl around the cone and recieve a pass from the coach for a second shot.
- Coaching points: Ensure players are using their backhand when going around the cones to that side. Players should make tight turns around the cones, leading with the puck, keeping both feet on the ice with the inside leg leading on the outside edge.

## Station 2 - Josh - Angling
- Two players go at a time
- Forward carry the puck along with wall and attempt to get to the net. 
- Defense angles the player with the puck and tries to keep them to the outside. Defense should try to take the puck and carry or pass it back to the coach/player lines.
- Coaching points: Forwards should protect the puck with their body. Encourage leaning into the defensive player to drive the net or use cut backs. Defense should stay with the forward and use an acitve stick and their body to separate the puck.

## Station 3 - Lina - Skating skills
- Two lines of players will do the same movements through the cones. Higher-skilled players can do these with pucks. Lower skilled players should go without pucks and focus on their footwork.
- Variations:
    1. Forward the whole way: Around cone 2, cone 1, cone 3, cone 2, cone 4, cone 3, to the boards to line up
    2. Forward to cone 2, backward to cone 1, forward to cone 3, backward to cone 2, forward to cone 4, backward to cone 3, to boards to line up.
    3. Stops: cone 2, cone 1, cone 3, cone 2, cone 4, cone 3, boards to line up.
- Run each variation twice so the players make the turns both directions.
- Coaching points:
    - For less skilled players, focus on footwork. Turns should be tight, both feet on the ice, and lead with the inside foot on the outside edge. Pivots to backwards should work like a stop with the player's back to the cone with a continual motion to backwards. Stops should be facing the correct direction and with two feet.
    - Higher skilled player with the puck should be doing all the things listed above, as well as leading with the stick and puck around the cones when turning forwards. Focus on puck control while still using the correct footwork.

## Station 4 - Brett



## Station 5 - Lorne
