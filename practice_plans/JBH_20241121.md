# Station Details
## NOTE: Station 1 and 2 will be run, then we will switch to stations 3, 4, and 5.

## Station 1 - Ryan and Pete
Skating race
- Two teams race eachother.
- The players skate backwards to the tire, then transition to forward as the go around it and skate forward back to the line.
- Run this version 2-3 times, then run this version:
  - The players skate forward with a puck to the tire, go around, then back to the line.

## Station 2 - Chris and Dave
Stops and starts
- Players go one at a time stopping at each cone.
- Players need to focus on making full stops with the appropiate foot. Coaches need to watch and enforce this.
- After the last cone, follow the path around the bumpers back to the line to stay out of the way of the drills.
- Switch to tight turns around the cones after 5 minutes.

## Station 3 - Dave and Pete
Net front battle 
- Two forwards and one defense battle in a loose puck situation in front of the goalie.
- The play starts with a shot from "long distance" from a third forward who crashes the net after the shot. This is meant to help encourage players to shoot from further out during games and players to be at the front of the net to battle for the puck on a rebound.
- The two forwards attempt to score.
- The goalie attempts to cover the puck and the defense helps the goalie by tieing up the forward or clearing the puck.
- The defense should also protect the goalie if they are able to cover the puck.

## Station 4 - Chris and Ryan
Controlled scrimage
